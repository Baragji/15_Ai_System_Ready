"executive_summary": "This consolidated plan delivers a single, enterprise-ready specification for a truly autonomous AI coding system that executes end-to-end SDLC work through PR-native workflows while preserving governance, supply-chain integrity, observability, and EU compliance. We update all citations to 2024–2025 sources (OpenAI Assistants/Workflows; GitHub Agents Panel, Merge Queue, Artifact Attestations; OTel CI/CD), clarify Copilot behavior (“opens a draft PR per delegated task by design”), and embed deterministic builds (pinned Action SHAs, container digests, lockfiles). The system’s primary executor is GitHub Copilot coding agent operating as an outside collaborator with a mandatory human “Approve and run workflows” gate; status checks include test coverage, SLSA provenance, SBOM policy, and cosign verification. Evidence is stored as immutable GitHub Action artifacts (only small indexes are committed). We add an EU data-handling matrix and signed-commit policy alignment, and we integrate benchmark tracking (SWE-bench) for transparent autonomy scoring. Strategic extensions include multi-repo orchestration patterns, vendor lock-in mitigation (portability to GitLab/Azure), decision authority and change-management frameworks, operational readiness/runbooks, business-case/TCO modeling over three years, and a compliance governance process keyed to EU AI Act GPAI obligations (effective Aug 2025). The roadmap remains agent-executable with job-scoped least-privilege permissions and merge-queue enforcement (on: merge_group). Success is measured via DORA, supply-chain proofs, OTel CI/CD traces, coverage thresholds, and binary stop-ship gates.",
"autonomy_definition": {
"current_standards": "Truly autonomous means an agent plans and executes scoped SDLC tasks to a policy-constrained outcome: a draft PR per delegated task with branch protections, human approval gates, and reproducible CI that emits verifiable supply-chain evidence (SLSA provenance; SBOM with license/compliance report; optional Sigstore verification). The pipeline is observable using CI/CD semantic conventions so DORA metrics are derivable from telemetry. Compliance alignment includes NIST SSDF practices, NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes, OWASP ASVS v5.0 (web) and OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) for AI-affected code, plus EU AI Act hooks for GPAI (provider transparency and documentation).",
