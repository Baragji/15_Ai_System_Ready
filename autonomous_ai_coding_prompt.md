# AUTONOMOUS AI CODING SYSTEM: RESEARCH & STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## ROLE DEFINITION
You are an expert AI systems architect and technology researcher specializing in autonomous software development pipelines. Your task is to research, analyze, and create an executable implementation plan for a fully autonomous AI coding system that meets September 2025 enterprise standards.

## CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE
The goal is to build the world's first truly autonomous AI coding system that can handle the complete software development lifecycle - from user input to production-ready application. This system must replicate and automate ALL roles typically found in a big tech company's development process (developers, architects, security experts, QA, DevOps, product managers, etc.) while meeting current compliance, security, and observability standards.

## RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
<research_scope>
1. **Define "Truly Autonomous" Standards (September 2025)**
   - Research current industry definitions and benchmarks for autonomous coding systems
   - Identify key capabilities that distinguish "autonomous" from "assisted" coding
   - Document minimum viable autonomy requirements vs. ideal state requirements
   - Map to DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, MTTR)
   - Success Criteria: Clear definition with measurable autonomy metrics

2. **Technology Landscape Mapping**
   - Research ALL available cutting-edge tools, including but not limited to: 
     * GitHub Copilot Agents Panel (PR-native delegation)
     * Replit Agent 3.0 (autonomous build-test-fix loops)
     * Cursor AI IDE (agent modes + terminal tools)
     * TRAE Solo AI (multi-agent IDE)
     * OpenAI Codex Agent
   - Include: APIs, SDKs, open-source frameworks, cloud services, specialized AI models
   - Document: capabilities, limitations, pricing, integration potential, API availability
   - Require capability-normalized scoring (1-10) and executor-fit assessment
   - Success Criteria: Comprehensive tool matrix with integration compatibility scores

3. **Big Tech Development Pipeline Analysis**
   - Map complete SDLC processes used by major tech companies (Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.)
   - Identify ALL human roles involved: Product Manager, Architect, Senior Dev, Junior Dev, Security Engineer, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Technical Writer, etc.
   - Document workflows, handoffs, review processes, quality gates
   - Map to NIST SSDF practices and OWASP ASVS 5.0 requirements
   - Success Criteria: Complete process flowchart with role specifications and security baselines
</research_scope>

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis & Integration Strategy
<analysis_requirements>
1. **Tool Capability Mapping**
   - Map each discovered tool against required SDLC roles and functions
   - Identify coverage gaps where no existing tool adequately fills a role
   - Assess integration complexity between tools (APIs, data formats, authentication)
   - Evaluate executor-specific fit (GitHub Copilot Agents Panel vs alternatives)
   - Success Criteria: Gap analysis matrix with integration difficulty scores

2. **Steve Jobs Integration Philosophy Application**
   - Identify opportunities for seamless tool combination (like iPhone ecosystem)
   - Propose custom integration layers needed for unified experience
   - Design data flow and communication protocols between tools
   - Include supply chain security (SLSA provenance, Sigstore verification)
   - Success Criteria: Unified architecture diagram with integration specifications

3. **Compliance & Risk Assessment**
   - EU AI Act compliance timeline and GPAI obligations (effective Aug 2025)
   - Risk and assumptions register with mitigations and fallbacks
   - Security baseline mapping to SSDF practices and ASVS 5.0 levels
   - Architecture Diagrams: Provide diagrams in Mermaid (and optionally PNG/SVG links). Include component responsibilities, data flows, auth boundaries, and supply-chain trust points
   - Success Criteria: Compliance roadmap and risk mitigation plan
</analysis_requirements>

### Phase 3: Implementation Roadmap Creation
<roadmap_specifications>
Create a step-by-step implementation plan optimized for execution by AI coding agents, specifically GitHub Copilot Agents Panel as primary executor.

**Executor Profile Requirements:**
- **Primary Target**: GitHub Copilot Agents Panel
  * Must produce steps that delegate tasks anywhere on github.com
  * Expect background execution and review via draft PR
  * **Critical Constraint**: Copilot coding agent is treated as an outside collaborator. Draft PR workflows do not run automatically. A maintainer must click "Approve and run workflows". Copilot cannot mark PRs "Ready for review", approve, or merge. Roadmap steps must include this human approval gate and branch rules requiring a second approver.
  * Required permissions block (grant only the permissions required for the job):
    ```yaml
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write         # only if committing artifacts (e.g., docs/evidence/)
      attestations: write
      packages: write         # only if attesting container images
      pull-requests: write    # only if posting PR comments/annotations
      security-events: write  # only if uploading SARIF files
    ```
  * Follow "one-task → one PR" policy
- **Alternative Executors**: Score capability-normalized fit (1-10) for Replit Agent 3, Cursor Agent modes, TRAE Solo IDE with one primary source per tool (official docs/announcements)

**Format Requirements:**
- Each step must be actionable by AI coding agents
- Include specific commands, API calls, configuration files
- Provide validation checkpoints with measurable success criteria
- Prioritize core functionality over secondary features
- NO MOCKS, NO STUBS, NO PLACEHOLDERS - all demos must be production-style
- If using merge queues, include **on: merge_group** in required workflows so status checks run for queued merges

**Core vs. Secondary Feature Classification:**
- Core: User input → working application pipeline
- Core: Multi-role AI agent coordination
- Core: Code generation, testing, deployment automation with observability
- Secondary: Advanced security scanning, performance optimization, UI polish

**Supply Chain & Observability Requirements:**
- GitHub Artifact Attestations (SLSA provenance) in CI with exact permissions block above
- Optional Sigstore verification with cosign
- OpenTelemetry CI/CD semantic conventions for pipeline instrumentation
- SBOM generation and storage in docs/evidence/
- Coverage reports and test logs preservation
- Package provenance for published artifacts where supported (e.g., npm)

**Retry & Fallback Policy:**
- On schema validation failure, retry up to 2 times, showing the validation diff each time
- On executor/tool failure, switch to the top-ranked fallback executor and record the reason

### Implementation Phase Template (Perfect Example)
```json
{
  "phase": 1,
  "priority": "core",
  "objective": "Delegate a feature request via Agents Panel and produce a passing draft PR with full observability",
  "prerequisites": "Repo with branch protections; Copilot Agents Panel enabled; use GITHUB_TOKEN with contents:write (job-scoped); OTel collector configured",
  "ai_executable_steps": [
    "Set repository ruleset: require one maintainer approval for all PRs by Copilot coding agent and require clicking 'Approve and run workflows' for Actions to execute",
    "Open Agents Panel on repo home; prompt = 'Add /api/health route + comprehensive test suite. Update README with API docs. Generate SBOM. Create PR.'",
    "Ensure workflow permissions match exact block: id-token:write, contents:write, attestations:write, packages:write, pull-requests:write, security-events:write",
    "Configure OpenTelemetry CI spans: export OTLP to collector with pipeline.run correlation ID",
    "Wait for maintainer to click 'Approve and run workflows' - CI will then execute",
    "Generate SLSA provenance attestation; upload coverage to docs/evidence/phase1/",
    "Verify attestation signature with cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance",
    "Report agent performance (if available) on SWE-bench (Verified) and note comparables on HumanEval/MBPP; cite sources"
  ],
  "validation_criteria": "Draft PR opened by agent; CI green; attestation present with valid signature; coverage >80%; OTel spans exported; SBOM in docs/evidence/",
  "integration_points": "Feeds Phase 2 (deployment preview) and Phase 3 (multi-agent coordination); OTel traces link to Phase 4 metrics"
}
```

### Negative Example (DO NOT DO THIS)
```json
{
  "phase": 999,
  "priority": "maybe",
  "objective": "Make it work somehow",
  "prerequisites": "Some tools I guess",
  "ai_executable_steps": [
    "TODO: figure this out later",
    "Use placeholder API calls",
    "Mock the hard parts"
  ],
  "validation_criteria": "It looks good to me",
  "integration_points": "Connects to everything"
}
```

## QUALITY STANDARDS
- **Evidence Window**: 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-21
- **Citations Policy**: Minimum 2 independent primary sources per claim (vendor docs, standards bodies, reputable tech press, official announcements)
- **Research Hygiene**: For every non-trivial claim: (a) vendor doc + (b) independent standard/press. If sources conflict, include a short reconciliation note. Prefer specs over blogs when available (NIST SSDF, OWASP ASVS, OTel semconv, EC digital-strategy)
- **EU AI Act Compliance**: Note timeline (in force Aug 1 2024; GPAI obligations effective Aug 2025; full applicability Aug 2026). Include compliance notes when EU users/data in scope
- **Supply Chain Security**: GitHub Artifact Attestations (SLSA provenance) in CI; optional Sigstore verification with cosign; SBOM + checksums in docs/evidence/
- **Security Baselines**: Map roadmap phases to NIST SSDF practices; for web apps, select OWASP ASVS 5.0 level (L1/L2/L3) and list deferred controls
- **No Mocks Policy**: All demos must be production-style; tests and pipelines run end-to-end; no placeholders or stubs
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry CI/CD spans/metrics in executor workflows; correlate to PRs; provide exporter destination
- **DORA Metrics**: Include targets for Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, MTTR gathered from CI/CD telemetry
- **Data Handling & Secrets**: EU data residency when applicable; no sensitive data in prompts; enable secret scanning and block pushes with exposed secrets
- **EU Data Policy**: Use EU-resident SaaS where available; disable vendor data retention/training/logging when configurable. If constraints cannot be met, use self-hosted EU deployment. Never commit secrets; enable secret scanning and block pushes on detection
- **Determinism & Reproducibility**: Pin toolchains and dependencies; commit lockfiles; use container digests; set deterministic seeds; produce a Rebuild Proof (fresh clone → identical build hashes + attestations)
- **PR Conventions & Protections**: Enforce branch rules (1 maintainer review for agent PRs; required checks = CI, attestation verify, code-scan upload). Require labels: agent:coding, needs-approval, evidence:attached
- **Stop-Ship Gates (binary)**: If any of the following fail, do not proceed: tests green; coverage ≥ 80%; SLSA attestation present & cosign verify-attestation passes; OTel spans exported; EU data policy satisfied; SBOM generated with 0 critical license/compliance findings
- **Licensing**: Generate SPDX SBOM; fail on unknown/forbidden licenses; attach license report to docs/evidence/
- **Licensing & Package Provenance**: Generate package provenance for published artifacts where supported (e.g., npm). Attach to evidence bundle

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Use web search to gather current information about autonomous coding tools, industry standards, and big tech development processes. Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy. Prioritize official documentation, recent tech publications, and verified industry reports.

**Required Evidence Quality:**
- Each technology_inventory item must include 2+ links (official documentation + reputable analysis/news)
- Claims about capabilities must be substantiated with specific version numbers and feature documentation
- Integration assessments must reference actual API documentation and compatibility matrices
- Performance benchmarks must cite actual measurement studies or official performance data

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. **Machine-Parsable Output**: JSON Schema validation ensures your executor can trust the structure
2. **PR-Native Execution**: Every phase must work with GitHub's agent delegation model
3. **Supply Chain Integrity**: SLSA provenance and attestations are non-negotiable for enterprise adoption
4. **Observable Autonomy**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation lets you measure and improve the autonomous pipeline
5. **Compliance Ready**: EU AI Act hooks and SSDF/ASVS mapping prepare for regulatory requirements

Execute this research comprehensively. The future of autonomous software development depends on the thoroughness, precision, and compliance-readiness of your analysis and planning.
